# Mini FOSS Universe

The **OpenAlgo Mini FOSS Universe** is a curated collection of open-source projects, SDKs, libraries, and integrations that extend the OpenAlgo ecosystem across languages, platforms, and workflows.

Whether you’re building trading strategies, data pipelines, dashboards, or AI-driven systems, OpenAlgo provides open-source tools that integrate seamlessly into every modern trading workflow.

This ecosystem is designed to be:

* **Modular** — use only what you need
* **Extensible** — customize and build on top of existing components
* **Language-agnostic** — work in the stack you’re most comfortable with
* **Production-ready** — stable APIs with long-term support

All projects in the Mini FOSS Universe are community-driven and built with real-world trading and automation use cases in mind.

**OpenAlgo Core** is the central heartbeat of the ecosystem — powering the API service, authentication, routing, and platform logic.\
\
All SDKs, libraries, and integrations interact with the API endpoints exposed by OpenAlgo Core.

### Libraries and SDKs

OpenAlgo provides official SDKs and libraries to help developers interact with the OpenAlgo API without making raw HTTP calls. These packages handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing, allowing you to focus on strategy and logic.

#### API Version

The current stable version of the OpenAlgo API is **v1**.

* All SDKs and integrations listed below are built against **API v1**
* v1 is stable, backward-compatible, and recommended for production use
* Future versions will be introduced without breaking existing v1 integrations
