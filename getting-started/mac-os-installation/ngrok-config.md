## Setting up the Ngrok Config File



1. Open the terminal in Mac
2. Enter the command `ngrok config edit`.
3. This opens the ngrok config file. Enter your Auth Token, Tunnel Name, hostname, and addr as follows:

```markup
version: "3"
tunnels:
    flask:
        proto: http
        hostname: <your-ngrok-free-domain>.ngrok-free.app
        addr: 127.0.0.1:5000
agent:
    authtoken: <your-ngrok-auth-token>
```

Replace `<Your Auth Token>` with your actual Ngrok authentication token and `<your-chosen-hostname>` with the hostname you’ve set up.



## &#x20;Security Best Practices When Using Ngrok

* **Keep Your Ngrok Auth Token Secure**: Your Ngrok authentication token is the key to creating tunnels with your account. Keep it secure to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Use Strong Authentication for Exposed Services**: If you’re exposing a web service or application, ensure it has its own strong authentication mechanism.
* **Monitor Tunnel Usage**: Regularly review logs and monitor tunnel usage for any unexpected or unauthorized access.
* **Limit Exposure Time**: Only keep tunnels open for as long as necessary. The longer a tunnel is open, the higher the potential security risk.
