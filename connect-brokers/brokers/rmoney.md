#### Step 2: Setup Environment Variables

Refer to the `.sample.env` file in your OpenAlgo folder and prepare your `.env` as follows:

```
# Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_BROKER_ORDER_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'YOUR_ORDER_API_SECRET'

BROKER_API_KEY_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_KEY'
BROKER_API_SECRET_MARKET = 'YOUR_BROKER_MARKET_API_SECRET'

REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/rmoney/callback'
```

Replace the values with actual credentials shown on your developer dashboard once approved.

#### **Step 3: Start OpenAlgo**

Once all environment variables are set and your apps are Active, you can now start OpenAlgo.

Ensure you have installed dependencies and set up the broker configuration properly. OpenAlgo will now be able to place orders and fetch market data through RMoney's XTS API.

This completes the integration process for RMoney broker with OpenAlgo.
