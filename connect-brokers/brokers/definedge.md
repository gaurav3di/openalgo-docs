**Configuring the .env File**&#x20;

The Definedge API Token is used as the API key and API Secrets as API Secret itself. Below is a sample configuration for the .env file     &#x20;

\#Definedge Broker Configuration

```
# Definedge Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_API_Token_here'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_API_Secret_here' 
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/definedge/callback' 
```

**Important Notes**

* Ensure that your **API Secret Key and API Token** are stored securely and is not shared publicly.
