**Configuring the .env File**&#x20;

The Definedge API Token is used as the API key and API Secrets as API Secret itself. Below is a sample configuration for the .env file     &#x20;

\#Definedge Broker Configuration

BROKER\_API\_KEY = 'your\_API\_Token\_here'

BROKER\_API\_SECRET = 'your\_API\_Secret\_here'&#x20;

REDIRECT\_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/definedge/callback' &#x20;

Replace your\_client\_id with your AliceBlue login user ID and your\_api\_secret\_here with the generated API secret key.Definedge Broker Configuration

**Important Notes**

* Ensure that your **API Secret Key** is stored securely and is not shared publicly.
* The **REDIRECT\_URL** should match the one registered with your API application.

Follow these steps to integrate AliceBlue with OpenAlgo successfully. If you encounter any issues, refer to the Definedge API documentation for further assistance.
