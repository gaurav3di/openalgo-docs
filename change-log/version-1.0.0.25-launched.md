#### Major Enhancement: Central Logging

Central Logging has been implemented as a major enhancement in OpenAlgo, significantly improving how logs are managed and providing a more robust and efficient system. This initiative involved a substantial refactoring effort, with approximately 2000+ lines of previous `print` statements now successfully migrated to the new central logging system.

* Central Logging Implemented:
  * A comprehensive effort to migrate various components and brokers to a unified, centralized logging system. This foundational change streamlines log collection and analysis.
  * Implementation of centralized logging across numerous brokers, including Zerodha, Upstox, Dhan, Kotak, 5paisa/Fivepaisaxts, Paytm, Flattrade, Shoonya, Tradejini, Aliceblue, Compositedge, Firstock, Groww, IIFL, Wisdom, Zebu, Pocketful, and Jainam, ensuring consistent logging practices across the platform.
  * Updated documentation to thoroughly reflect the new centralized logging system, aiding developers and users in understanding its functionality.
* Bug Fixes Issued to Central Logging:
  * Addressed specific issues with the Zerodha Adapter Logger and general logging imports, ensuring accurate log capture.
  * Resolved centralized logging issues for various brokers and their specific modules, including `funds.py`, `Upstox data.py`, Aliceblue, Compositedge, 5paisa, Paytm, Flattrade, Zerodha, Angel, Shoonya, Tradejini, Dhan, Kotak, Fivepaisaxts, IIFL, Wisdom, Zebu, Pocketful, and Jainam.
  * Fixed issues encountered during the migration to centralized logging in blueprints, `proxy_websockets`, services, and `restx_api` folders, ensuring a smooth transition and proper log routing.
  * Corrected instances of duplicate logging entries, reducing log clutter and improving readability.
  * Updated master contract to include central logging and resolved minor string formatting issues, ensuring data integrity within logs.
