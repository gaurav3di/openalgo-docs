# Monetization

**How Developers Can Monetize OpenAlgo (AGPL v3.0 License)**



OpenAlgo is an open-source, algorithmic trading framework written in Python under the AGPL v3.0 license. The AGPL enforces that any modifications or use of the software over a network must be made available to users under the same license.

If you take OpenAlgo, modify its core features (e.g., add a new trading algorithm or improve the user interface), and host it as a web service where users can log in and trade using your modified version. Under the AGPL-3.0 license, you are required to:\
\
i)Share the source code of the modified version with your users.\
ii)Ensure they have access to the exact changes you made to the original OpenAlgo.

This requirement ensures that even if the software is accessed over a network (like through a web app or SaaS platform), the users still have the freedom to view, modify, and distribute the code.



This ensures that any advancements built on OpenAlgo are contributed back to the community, but it does not preclude monetization efforts. Hereâ€™s how developers can monetize OpenAlgo within these constraints:

\


**1. Open-Source Foundation with AGPL Compliance:**

OpenAlgo remains open-source under the AGPL v3.0 license, which mandates that any modifications must be shared with the community, including those used over a network. Developers can build new features and extensions but must ensure that any derivatives or services that expose OpenAlgo through a network also make the source code available to users.

**2. Paid Plugins and Extensions (With Source Code Disclosure):**

Developers can create and sell plugins or extensions for OpenAlgo. However, under the AGPL license, if these plugins are used as part of a networked service (e.g., SaaS), the source code must be made available to the users of that service. Monetization can still happen by charging for the plugin itself, packaging, installation services, or enhanced support.

**3. Custom Solutions and Consulting:**

One major avenue for monetization under AGPL is offering custom development or consulting services. While code must remain open, developers can charge for the expertise in creating tailored solutions for specific trading needs or strategies. This ensures that the code adheres to the licensing terms but allows developers to monetize their knowledge and implementation services.

**4. Hosted Services and Premium Features:**

While AGPL requires the release of source code for any network service, developers can still offer value-added services around OpenAlgo, such as managed hosting, premium support, or data integrations that are separate from the core plugin functionality. These services can be charged for on a subscription basis while ensuring full compliance with AGPL by making any necessary source code available.

**5. Support, Training, and Documentation:**

Developers can create value around the ecosystem by offering paid support plans, training sessions, or premium documentation. This could include webinars, one-on-one mentoring for algorithmic trading, or detailed guides for deploying OpenAlgo-based systems. Since these are services and not software, they do not require source code disclosure and are fully monetizable.

\


**How OpenAlgo Should Not Be Monetized:**

\


**1. Closed-Source Modifications or Plugins:**

Under the AGPL license, any modifications or extensions to OpenAlgo that are deployed over a network must be open-source. Developers should not attempt to sell closed-source versions of the framework or plugins that violate the AGPL by keeping modifications proprietary.

**2. Violation of AGPL Network Compliance:**

Developers should avoid monetizing services that make use of OpenAlgo over a network without releasing the associated source code. Failure to comply with the AGPL network provisions could lead to legal challenges and compromise the integrity of the platform.

**3. Non-Disclosure of Derivatives:**

Any attempts to monetize derivatives of OpenAlgo without making the source code publicly available will breach the AGPL license. Developers must ensure that all modifications, particularly those used to power online services or platforms, are properly disclosed under the same AGPL terms.



The AGPL v3.0 license fosters a thriving community while ensuring transparency and sharing of innovations. Developers are encouraged to monetize responsibly by adhering to the open-source principles that benefit everyone involved in the OpenAlgo ecosystem.
