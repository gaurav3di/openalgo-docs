### Theme Usage

#### Live Mode (Production Trading)

When trading with real money in **Live Mode**, you have access to **29 themes** (all except dracula).

**Quick Theme Toggle (Navbar)**

The navbar includes a convenient theme switcher that toggles between:

* **Light Theme** - Default bright interface
* **Dark Theme** - Reduced eye strain for extended trading sessions

Simply click the sun/moon icon in the navigation bar to instantly switch.

**Full Theme Selection (Profile Page)**

For access to all 29 themes:

1. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Profile**
2. Click the **Theme Preferences** tab
3. Browse the complete theme gallery
4. Click any theme to apply instantly
5. Your selection is automatically saved

**Note**: The dracula theme is **not available** in Live Mode as it is exclusively reserved for Analyze Mode.

#### Analyze Mode (Sandbox Environment)

The **Analyze Mode** provides a risk-free testing environment for validating strategies and API requests without executing real trades.

**Fixed Dracula Theme**

When you enter Analyze Mode:

* **Auto-Switch**: Theme automatically changes to `dracula`
* **Visual Indicator**: The distinctive purple dracula theme clearly signals you're in a safe testing environment
* **Locked Theme**: Theme switcher is disabled to prevent confusion
* **Safety Feature**: This ensures you always know when you're in test mode vs. live trading

**Why a Fixed Theme?**

The locked dracula theme in Analyze Mode serves critical purposes:

1. **Visual Confirmation**: Instantly recognize you're in test mode
2. **Prevent Confusion**: Avoid accidentally thinking you're in Live Mode
3. **Consistent Experience**: All users see the same interface in documentation and support
4. **Safety First**: Clear distinction reduces risk of accidental live trading

**Returning to Live Mode**

When you exit Analyze Mode:

* Your **previous theme is automatically restored**
* Theme switching becomes available again
* All 29 Live Mode themes are accessible

### How to Change Themes

#### Method 1: Quick Toggle (Navbar)

1. Locate the theme switcher icon in the navigation bar (sun/moon icon)
2. Click to toggle between light and dark themes
3. Change applies instantly

**Best For**: Quick switching during different times of day

#### Method 2: Full Selection (Profile Page)

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation menu
2. Select **Profile** from the dropdown
3. Navigate to the **Theme Preferences** tab
4. Browse the theme gallery showing all available themes
5. Click any theme card to preview and apply
6. Current theme is highlighted with a primary ring
7. Preview the color palette (primary, secondary, accent, success, error)

**Best For**: Exploring all themes and finding your perfect match

#### Method 3: Programmatic (Advanced)

Developers can change themes programmatically using the theme manager:

```javascript
// Set a specific theme
window.themeManager.setTheme('cyberpunk');

// Get current theme
const currentTheme = window.themeManager.getCurrentTheme();

// Check if in Analyze Mode
const isAnalyze = window.themeManager.isAnalyzeMode();

// Restore previous theme (after Analyze Mode)
window.themeManager.restorePreviousTheme();
```

### Technical Details

#### Technology Stack

OpenAlgo's theming system is built on modern web technologies:

* **DaisyUI**: `5.1.27` - Component library providing the 30 themes
* **Tailwind CSS**: `4.1.14` - Utility-first CSS framework foundation
* **PostCSS**: `8.4.49` - CSS processing and optimization
* **Autoprefixer**: `10.4.20` - Cross-browser compatibility

#### Theme Implementation

Themes are implemented using pure CSS custom properties (CSS variables):

```html
<!-- Theme is applied via data attribute -->
<html data-theme="cyberpunk">
```

This approach provides:

* **Zero Runtime JavaScript**: Themes are pure CSS, no JS overhead
* **Instant Switching**: CSS variable changes are immediate
* **Better Performance**: No JavaScript recalculation on theme change
* **SSR Compatible**: Themes work with server-side rendering

#### Storage & Persistence

Theme preferences are stored in two locations:

1.  **localStorage**: Persists across browser sessions

    ```javascript
    localStorage.getItem('theme') // e.g., "dark"
    ```
2.  **sessionStorage**: Maintains consistency during navigation

    ```javascript
    sessionStorage.getItem('theme') // Current session theme
    ```

#### Cross-Tab Synchronization

Theme changes automatically sync across browser tabs:

* Open multiple OpenAlgo tabs
* Change theme in one tab
* All other tabs update instantly via storage events

#### Flash Prevention

OpenAlgo prevents theme "flash" on page load using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE):

```javascript
(function() {
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', savedTheme);
})();
```

This sets the theme before the page renders, eliminating white flashes when using dark themes.

### Customizing Themes (Advanced)

#### Tailwind Configuration

OpenAlgo's Tailwind configuration is minimal and extensible:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.mjs
import daisyui from 'daisyui';

export default {
  content: [
    "./templates/**/*.html",
    "./static/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}
  },
  plugins: [daisyui]
}
```

#### Adding Custom Themes

Developers can add custom themes by extending the DaisyUI configuration:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.mjs
export default {
  plugins: [daisyui],
  daisyui: {
    themes: [
      "light",
      "dark",
      // ... other themes
      {
        mytheme: {
          "primary": "#0000ff",
          "secondary": "#ff00ff",
          "accent": "#00ffff",
          "neutral": "#3d4451",
          "base-100": "#ffffff",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

#### Theme Color Palette

Each DaisyUI theme includes these semantic color tokens:

| Token          | Purpose            | Examples                      |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `primary`      | Main brand color   | Buttons, links, active states |
| `secondary`    | Supporting color   | Secondary buttons, accents    |
| `accent`       | Highlight color    | Badges, special notifications |
| `neutral`      | Neutral elements   | Borders, dividers, disabled   |
| `base-100`     | Background color   | Page background               |
| `base-200`     | Subtle background  | Cards, containers             |
| `base-300`     | Borders & dividers | Input borders, separators     |
| `base-content` | Text color         | Body text, labels             |
| `info`         | Informational      | Info alerts, messages         |
| `success`      | Success states     | Profit, completed orders      |
| `warning`      | Warning states     | Pending, caution messages     |
| `error`        | Error states       | Loss, failed orders           |

### Browser Compatibility

OpenAlgo themes work across all modern browsers:

* âœ… Chrome/Edge 90+
* âœ… Firefox 88+
* âœ… Safari 14+
* âœ… Opera 76+
* âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

**Note**: Internet Explorer is not supported as it lacks CSS custom property support.

### Troubleshooting

#### Theme Not Changing

If your theme doesn't change:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard reload with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Check localStorage**: Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage â†’ verify `theme` key exists
3. **Disable Browser Extensions**: Some extensions may interfere with theme switching
4. **Try Incognito Mode**: Rules out extension conflicts

#### Theme Flashing on Page Load

If you see a white flash before the theme loads:

1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
2. Check that the theme IIFE in `theme.js` is loading before the page renders
3. Verify no browser extensions are blocking inline scripts

#### Analyze Mode Theme Won't Change

This is **expected behavior**. The dracula theme is locked in Analyze Mode for safety. To change themes:

1. Exit Analyze Mode
2. Return to Live Mode
3. Select your preferred theme
4. Theme will be restored when you exit Analyze Mode again

#### Custom Theme Not Appearing

If you've added a custom theme:

1. Verify `tailwind.config.mjs` syntax is correct
2. Rebuild CSS: `npm run build:css`
3. Add theme name to `themes` array in `static/js/theme.js`
4. Restart the application server
