# Action Center

### What is Action Center?

**Action Center** is like a "shopping cart approval system" for your trading orders. Instead of orders executing immediately, they wait in a queue for you to manually review and approve them before they go to your broker.

Think of it as a **safety checkpoint** between your trading strategy and your real money.

### Why Would You Use It?

#### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Testing a New Strategy**

* You wrote a Python trading bot that generates buy/sell signals
* You're not 100% confident it works correctly yet
* Instead of letting it trade automatically, you enable Action Center
* Now every order waits for your approval - you can catch mistakes before they cost you money

**Example 2: High-Risk Trades**

* Your strategy generates a signal to buy 1000 shares of a volatile stock
* You want to review the order before it executes
* Action Center lets you verify quantity, price, and timing before confirming

**Example 3: Learning and Monitoring**

* You want to understand what signals your strategy is generating
* Action Center shows you every order before execution
* Great for learning how your algorithm behaves in real market conditions

### How It Works

#### Two Modes

**1. Auto Mode (Default) - Fully Automated**

```
Trading Signal → OpenAlgo → Broker → Order Executed
                (instant)
```

Orders execute immediately without any manual intervention.

**2. Semi-Auto Mode - Manual Approval Required**

```
Trading Signal → OpenAlgo → Action Center (WAIT) → You Approve → Broker → Order Executed
                            (paused here)              ↓
                                                 You Reject → Order Cancelled
```

Orders wait in Action Center for you to review and approve.

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Enable Semi-Auto Mode

1. Go to **Profile** → **API Key** page
2. Find **"Order Execution Mode"** section
3. Turn ON the toggle switch (it will turn orange)
4. Status changes from "Auto Mode" to "Semi-Auto Mode"

#### Step 2: Send Orders from Your Strategy

Your Python code stays exactly the same:

```python
api.placeorder({
    "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "symbol": "SBIN",
    "action": "BUY",
    "quantity": "10"
})
```

But now the response will be different:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Order queued for approval in Action Center",
    "mode": "semi_auto"
}
```

#### Step 3: Review Orders in Action Center

1. Click **"Action Center"** in the main menu
2. You'll see a badge showing how many orders are pending
3. Click on "Pending" tab to see orders waiting for approval

#### Step 4: Approve or Reject

For each order, you can:

* **Approve**: Click green "Approve" button → Order sends to broker
* **Reject**: Click red "Reject" button → Order cancelled, never sent to broker

### What You Can See in Action Center

For each pending order:

* **Symbol** (e.g., "SBIN")
* **Action** (BUY or SELL)
* **Quantity** (e.g., 10 shares)
* **Price** (e.g., ₹625.50)
* **Order Type** (MARKET, LIMIT, etc.)
* **When it was created** (e.g., "2 minutes ago")
* **Current status** (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

### Tabs in Action Center

1. **Pending** - Orders waiting for your action
2. **Approved** - Orders you approved and sent to broker
3. **Rejected** - Orders you declined
4. **All Orders** - Complete history

### Special Features

#### Auto-Refresh

The "Pending" tab refreshes every 30 seconds automatically, so you always see the latest orders.

#### Statistics Dashboard

At the top, you see:

* Pending Approval: 5 orders
* Buy Orders: 3
* Sell Orders: 2
* Approved: 15
* Rejected: 2

#### Audit Trail

Every action is logged:

* Who approved/rejected
* When it was approved/rejected
* Rejection reason (if you provide one)

### Common Questions

#### Q: Do I need to change my trading code?

**A:** No! Your API calls stay exactly the same. Just toggle the mode in settings.

#### Q: What happens if I don't approve/reject orders?

**A:** They stay in the Pending queue indefinitely. Your strategy will keep generating signals, but they won't execute until you approve.

#### Q: Can I switch back to Auto Mode anytime?

**A:** Yes! Just toggle the switch OFF in API Key settings. New orders will execute immediately again.

#### Q: Does this work with all order types?

**A:** Yes! Works with:

* Regular orders (`placeorder`)
* Smart orders (`placesmartorder`)
* Basket orders (`basketorder`)
* Split orders (`splitorder`)
* Options orders (`optionsorder`)

#### Q: Can I see which orders my strategy generated vs which I approved?

**A:** Yes! Each order shows:

* Created time (when strategy sent it)
* Approved time (when you clicked Approve)
* Broker order ID (after execution)

### Quick Comparison

| Feature              | Auto Mode             | Semi-Auto Mode           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Order Execution**  | Immediate             | After approval           |
| **Your Involvement** | None                  | Review each order        |
| **Safety**           | High risk (no checks) | Low risk (manual review) |
| **Speed**            | Very fast             | Slower (manual)          |
| **Best For**         | Proven strategies     | Testing, learning        |

### When to Use Which Mode

#### Use Auto Mode When:

* Your strategy is proven and tested
* You need high-frequency trading
* You trust the strategy 100%
* Speed is critical

#### Use Semi-Auto Mode When:

* Testing a new strategy
* Learning algorithmic trading
* High-risk trades need verification
* You want full control over every order

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: You're testing a new momentum strategy

1. **Morning 9:00 AM**
   * Enable Semi-Auto mode in settings
   * Start your Python trading bot
2. **9:30 AM** - Market opens
   * Your bot generates BUY signal for RELIANCE
   * Order appears in Action Center "Pending" tab
3. **9:31 AM** - You review
   * Symbol: RELIANCE ✅ (Correct)
   * Quantity: 10 ✅ (Looks good)
   * Price: ₹2,500 ✅ (Reasonable)
   * Click "Approve"
4. **9:31 AM** - Order executes
   * Sent to broker
   * Shows "Approved" status
   * Broker order ID: 240612000123456
5. **10:00 AM** - Another signal
   * Your bot wants to SELL 100 shares of INFY
   * Wait... 100 shares seems too much!
   * Click "Reject" with reason: "Quantity too large"
6. **End of Day**
   * Review statistics: 10 approved, 2 rejected
   * Adjust your strategy code to fix the quantity issue

### Tips for Success

1. **Start with Semi-Auto** when testing new strategies
2. **Switch to Auto** only when you're confident
3. **Monitor the Pending tab** regularly (it auto-refreshes)
4. **Use rejection reasons** to track why you rejected orders
5. **Review history** in "All Orders" tab to learn from patterns
