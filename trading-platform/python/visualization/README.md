The visualization framework supports various chart types including correlation heatmaps for portfolio analysis, candlestick charts with technical overlays, normalized performance comparisons, and statistical analysis charts. All visualizations integrate seamlessly with OpenAlgo's 80+ technical indicators and support multiple exchanges (NSE, BSE, MCX) with professional styling options for publication-quality output.
